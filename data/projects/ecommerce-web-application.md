I led a programming team of 6 people and handled most of the backend code during a bootcamp in
university, where we successfully developed an e-commerce web application using the Next.js
framework with CRUD functionalities (and PayPal SDKs for payment processing). 

In this role, our group
achieved a perfect score of 100/100, showcasing my strong analytical skills, passion for programming,
and commitment to delivering high-quality results.
