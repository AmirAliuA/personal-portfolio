When I was a kid, one of the fondest memories I had was playing Tom and Jerry: Fists of Furry and Tom and Jerry: War of the Whiskers with my twin brother.
Those games were a staple of our childhood and we'd spend hours laughing and competing against each other, trying to land the perfect pie throw or dodge
a frying pan. The chaos, the humor and the charm of those games were unmatched, and it always felt like Tom and Jerry had come to life in our living room.

Fast forward to today, I've decided to embark on a project that feels like a love letter to those memories. I'm combining the best elements of Fists of Furry
and War of the Whiskers into one ultimate game using Unity. This isn't just about recreating the old games; it's about taking the essence of what made them 
great and giving them a modern twist.

To bring this vision to life, I'm using:
- Unity: The backbone of the project, where all the magic happens. Unity gives me the flexibility to craft the gameplay mechanics and bring the characters to life.
- Blender: For creating and refining 3D models. The original games had a distinct look, and I'm striving to capture that nostalgic charm while modernizing the visuals.
- C# Programming: Writing the scripts to handle character movement, animations, and interactions. This is where the gameplay really comes together.
- Texture and Animation Extraction: I'm carefully studying gameplay footage and extracting inspiration from the original games.

### The Vision
The new game will merge the frantic, fast-paced gameplay of Fists of Furry with the expanded mechanics and arenas from War of the Whiskers. I want players to feel the same excitement my brother and I felt but with updated visuals, smoother mechanics, and new surprises.

Some key features I’m working on include:
- Dynamic Arenas: Interactive environments where players can use objects as weapons—just like the originals.
- Multiplayer Support: Local and online modes so friends (or siblings) can relive those competitive moments.
- Modern Graphics: A fresh coat of paint using Blender and Unity’s rendering pipeline to make the characters and arenas pop.

### A Personal Journey
This project is more than just a technical challenge; it’s deeply personal. It’s about honoring those carefree days spent with my brother, laughing at the chaos on screen. Working on this game feels like I’m weaving those childhood memories into something tangible that I can share with others.

As I progress, I’ll be documenting each step—from designing the characters to coding the gameplay. It’s a journey that’s equal parts nostalgic and exciting, and I can’t wait to see it come to life.

Stay tuned for updates as I continue to build this tribute to Tom and Jerry: Fists of Furry and War of the Whiskers!
