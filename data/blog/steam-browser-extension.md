# What is this & why I made this extension & how it works
For years, gamers from Kosovo like myself have been avid users of Steam, the renowned gaming platform that has revolutionized the way we play and connect with others in the gaming community. Yet, there's been an undeniable oversight that's persisted over time – the absence of the Kosovo flag on Steam community profiles.

In a platform where personalization is key, the absence of a simple flag can seem insignificant to some, but for those of us from Kosovo, it's a glaring omission. It's a representation of our identity, our pride, and our sense of belonging in the global gaming community.

Despite numerous pleas, requests, and posts from users across various methods over the years, Valve, the company behind Steam, has yet to address this seemingly straightforward issue. It's a frustration shared by many Kosovo gamers who have waited patiently for a resolution, only to be met with silence from the platform we love.

Fed up with waiting for Valve to take action, I decided to take matters into my own hands. With a simple browser extension, I set out to fix the missing Kosovo flag on Steam community profiles. The solution was straightforward – the extension detects when a Steam profile is being browsed on steamcommunity.com and automatically replaces the missing Kosovo flag with the correct one stored within the extension.

So, to Valve, I say this: thank you for providing us with an incredible platform that has brought joy and entertainment to millions around the world. But please, it barely takes 10 seconds for you to fix this.
