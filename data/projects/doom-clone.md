Alright, so here’s the deal: I’m making Doom… but in Unity. Yeah. The classic, old-school Doom—the one with pixelated demons and that iconic rock music—is getting a fresh coat of paint, but still staying true to its roots. Why? Because Doom is legendary, and I figured it’d be fun to take a swing at recreating it in a modern engine while keeping the retro vibe intact.

### What’s the Plan?
- The Classic Feel: Doom’s movement is fast, fluid, and super satisfying. I’m working on making sure that the gameplay stays as close to the original as possible. No unnecessary slowdowns, just good ol' action.
- Retro Vibes, Modern Touches: Of course, the pixel art was a huge part of Doom’s charm. But I want to modernize it a bit, keeping that 90s aesthetic while adding some cooler lighting and visual effects that give it a more polished feel.
- The Sound: Let’s be real, Doom’s soundtrack slaps. I’m making sure the music, sound effects, and the overall audio all match the chaos and fun of running through hell while blasting demons. Nothing’s getting lost in translation here.

### Updates
It's been a blast so far, and I'm excited to share more updates as I get deeper into the development process. Stay tuned for more details, screenshots, and maybe even some gameplay videos soon. Let’s get this Doom train rolling!
